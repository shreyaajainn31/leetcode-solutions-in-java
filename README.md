Solution to leetcode questions in java


1. I have solved various leetcode questions in java. Just download the file and run the code. 

2. The code will currently run only one test case. On leetcode, it passes all the test cases. You can refer to the links given in the solution. 

3. Some of the questions aren't complete codes. The functions are working perfectly in leetcode, however I have not created a test case with that case. You can run those questions on leetcode easily.
